Description: scCalibratoR is a Bioconductor package designed to address 
    challenges in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, including 
    batch effect correction and annotation refinement. The package enables 
    the alignment of single-cell datasets to a trusted reference dataset, 
    correcting for batch effects while preserving biological variability. 
    Additionally, scCalibratoR identifies and corrects potential 
    misannotations by highlighting the genes driving these discrepancies. 
    Users can visualize the alignment and correction processes, ensuring more 
    accurate and consistent results across diverse single-cell datasets.
